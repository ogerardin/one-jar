<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
OK, so I'm making some of these up.  But some of them were real questions.  Can you tell
the difference?
<ul>
<li>
Q: My application reads its configuration out of a file.  How do I make it into a One-JAR?
<p class="half-line">A: Naughty application!  But many are.  Put your file into the 
One-JAR archive (e.g. config.properties), then add the following line to the <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file:
<pre>One-Jar-Expand: config.properties.</pre>
<p class="half-line">The first time you run the One-JAR archive, this file will be expanded.  If you update the
archive, it will be overwritten on the next expansion.  The expansion mechanism can handle
both files and folders.  
</li>
<li>
Q: I don't understand what One-JAR is doing?
<p class="half-line">A: Turn on diagnostics using <code>java -Done-jar.verbose=true -jar &lt;one-jar.jar&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>
Q: But I still can't understand why my application is failing!
<p class="half-line">A: Look at the <code>JarClassLoader.java</code> file which is distributed with the downloads.
It holds all the secrets.
</li>
<li>
Q: Where's the source code?
<p class="half-line">A: The essential source code is in the distribution.  The extended source code and a full Eclipse development
environment is located at the SourceForge CVS site with anonymous access (no password required): <code>:pserver:anonymous@one-jar.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/one-jar</code>.
This site contains a master Ant <code>build.xml</code> file which can rebuild the distribution and perform extensive regression testing, 
so if you want to submit a patch it is highly recommended that you (1) add a new test for the patch, and (2) run the existing tests.

</ul>
Seriously though, since its release in Summer 2004 there have been very few actual questions: 
basically, One-JAR just works.
